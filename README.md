 # Searchlight Promotions
Searchlight Promotions is a live music promotions company that specifically caters to the rock and metal community, in Norwich. It is the combined efforts of two music fans who have over 25 years’ experience in promoting rock and metal bands in East Anglia.

The website serves to increase the company’s visibility on the internet and functions as an additional marketing tool to reach fans and emerging musicians (hitherto known as users) interesting in attending or playing at gigs in Norwich.

Introduction
I approached a fellow metal-head (further referred to as 'the client') who owns a music promotions company in Norwich, and asked if he would like a website as he did not have one, for my first project. They agreed to have one built using the information that they had available on Facebook, for the content of the website, as this was currently his sole marketing platform. 

## 1. Client Brief
The client stipulated the following: 

1.	it must be visually striking, following a colour theme in the style of other rock and metal promotions web sites, but move away from the standard red, black and white colour palette
2.	a very simple site that gives just enough information about the company, but focusses on the events
3.	must scroll (up and down) passed the events when navigating the site
4.	only leaving the site to buy tickets
5.	must not advertise Facebook (or any other social media), but have a link to their Facebook page at the bottom for those that do use Facebook 
6.	must follow the style of Facebook and other social media platforms, using a single finger or thumb to scroll
7.	must be easily navigable without the use of additional “clicking on menus” (the Client)

## 2. The Aim and Purpose of the Site
The primary aim is to create a presence beyond the scope of social media to attract rock and metal fans, as well as emerging new rock and metal musicians, to current events happening in Norwich encouraging contact via email.

The purpose of the site is to showcase upcoming events and to boost ticket sales for each of the gigs by attracting rock and metal fans who don't necessarily use social media. Further, the site must reflect the promotional element of the business to attract unsigned rock and metal artists who would like to get in contact with the company for promotion in Norwich. 

## 3. Goals
To create a website that:
1.	looks visually striking in line with current marketing material
2.	uses a colour palette that reflects the rock and metal community, but moves away from the standard red, black and white themes used on other sites
3.	creates a form that encourages contact from fans who may like additional information as well as encourages contact from potential bands who would like to be promoted in and around Norwich 
4.	shows a clear and simple guide to what is on offer
5.	encourage contact via email
6.	smooth scrolling using the ‘single’ digit’ principle
7.	fully responsive across all devises
