 # Searchlight Promotions
Searchlight Promotions is a live music promotions company that specifically caters to the rock and metal community, in Norwich. It is the combined efforts of two music fans who have over 25 years’ experience in promoting rock and metal bands in East Anglia.

The website serves to increase the company’s visibility on the internet and functions as an additional marketing tool to reach fans and emerging musicians (hitherto known as users) interesting in attending or playing at gigs in Norwich.

## 1. Introduction
I approached a fellow metal-head (further referred to as 'the client') who owns a music promotions company in Norwich, and asked if he would like a website as he did not have one, for my first project. They agreed to have one built using the information that they had available on Facebook, for the content of the website, as this was currently his sole marketing platform. 

## 2. Client Brief
The client stipulated the following: 

1.	it must be visually striking, following a colour theme in the style of other rock and metal promotions web sites, but move away from the standard red, black and white colour palette
2.	a very simple site that gives just enough information about the company, but focusses on the events
3.	must scroll (up and down) passed the events when navigating the site
4.	only leaving the site to buy tickets
5.	must not advertise Facebook (or any other social media), but have a link to their Facebook page at the bottom for those that do use Facebook 
6.	must follow the style of Facebook and other social media platforms, using a single finger or thumb to scroll
7.	must be easily navigable without the use of additional “clicking on menus” (the Client)

## 3. The Aim and Purpose of the Site
The primary aim is to create a presence beyond the scope of social media to attract rock and metal fans, as well as emerging new rock and metal musicians, to current events happening in Norwich encouraging contact via email.

The purpose of the site is to showcase upcoming events and to boost ticket sales for each of the gigs by attracting rock and metal fans who don't necessarily use social media. Further, the site must reflect the promotional element of the business to attract unsigned rock and metal artists who would like to get in contact with the company for promotion in Norwich. 

## 4. Goals
To create a website that:
1.	looks visually striking in line with current marketing material
2.	uses a colour palette that reflects the rock and metal community, but moves away from the standard red, black and white themes used on other sites
3.	creates a form that encourages contact from fans who may like additional information as well as encourages contact from potential bands who would like to be promoted in and around Norwich 
4.	shows a clear and simple guide to what is on offer
5.	encourage contact via email
6.	smooth scrolling using the ‘single’ digit’ principle
7.	fully responsive across all devises

## 5. Planning and Development
### 1. Target Audience

  2. younger rock and metal fans looking to support artists, locally
  3. emerging, unsigned rock and metal musicians/bands looking to be promoted in Norwich
  4. other music promoters who may want to collaborate

## 6. Wire Frames
The wireframes served as a guide throughout the design of the website. They allowed for collaboration with the client when initially discussing the layout and functionality. Below are images to each of the different layouts for mobile, tablet and desktop devices. 

There was some deviation from the original wireframes as the project developed. Initially, I had included a navbar, but at the clients request it was changed to a header instead. 

  1. Desk Top:

  ![wf-desk-top-welcome](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1344b41c-bd9e-443b-a33b-9803b602790a)
  ![wf-desk-top-about](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3fcd4d7-bcec-4e2d-9c7e-4b04094bd8f8)
  ![wf-desk-top-events](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66474a93-d162-487f-9655-e0dbd17be41b)
  ![wf-desk-top-contact](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82dba6bc-ce12-4be6-b32b-9af9bb0d6645)   
  
  2. Mobile:

## 7. Features
 ### 1.	Header
 Was originally intended as a navbar. However, the client did not want any user to “click away from the content” (the client), but rather use the same functionality of the ‘single digit scroll’ as employed by other social media platforms.

  Instead, the logo was incorporated as the header and then later used in the footer to conclude the page.

 ### 2.	Logo
 The logo was designed to show a spotlight with the ‘metal-horns’ inside, centre. Although not visible in the header unless ‘zoomed-in’, it is visible in scaled versions on the Thank you and Error Messages page. The logo has now been incorporated in other marketing materials.

 ### 3.	Typography
 Two fonts were used for the typography of the site:
  1.	The first being ….. chosen to represent a rock and metal genre
  2.	The second choice was ….. This was chosen to create an over-all appeal of an old-school type face

### 4.	Carousel
Showcases 3 images of artists with the titles that promote the purpose of the business, all separated by 3 posters (item list number 4) of the upcoming festival: ROXOFF 25, with the confirmed artists. The 3 images all had the title: Searching for & Promoting - Unsigned Rock & Metal Bands 4 Norwich

4. 


 ### 5.	Page Titles
 Simple page titles that allow a user to know where they are on the website. I designed them offset to the left as you would find them on a note pad.
 
 ### 6.	Welcome
 A simple title to let the user know that they have been invited and welcomed to the site that sits alongside the carousel images

### 7.	About
Indicates a section of the website design for the users to get to know the business owners, how it all came into being and planned future developments

### 8.	Events
Indicates the section of the web page where the users can find out what gigs have been planned and how to get tickets

### 9.	Contact
Points the user directly to the section of the website where they can contact the owners of the business

### 10.	Call to Action Buttons (cta-btns)
Are styled to match the colour scheme of the website that do not overwhelm the user’s experience. 

   There are two different cta-btns:
     1.	Two general cta-btns; one under the carousel and the other under the about section. Both of which would take the use to the Searchlight Promotions listings page at WeGotTickets.com, and
     2.	Eight cta-btns that direct the user to each event’s ticket listing on WeGotTickets.com

### 11.	About Image
The about image was chosen to encapsulate the energy of the company with both owners enjoying themselves with the lead singer of an American touring band: The Midnight Devils.

### 12.	Event Cards
All event card images are current marketing image posters used on Facebook and other marketing media. Their size is not consistent, but it was more important to keep the material consistent than to resize the images. The event cards were set to the end of the column to create some cohesion for the viewing experience, placing the cta-btns in-line with each other.

### 13.	Contact Form
The contact form was set to be in-line with all other content. This allowed for greater sizing of each element considering the aging demographic who may not be as proficient as the younger users’ typing skills.

  The contact form has been designed to be simple. It contains four required fields, a non-required filed, a submit button, link to the client's Facebook page and WeGotTickets page:
    1.	First Name (require),
    2.	Last Name (required),
    3.	Email address Irequire) and'
    4.	Message (required)
    5. There is an optional element for a phone number if the user wishes to be contacted by phone with a placeholder message to indicate how the number should be inputted.
    6. Once submitted the user is directed to a Thank You Message.

### 14.	Thank You Message
The thank you message follows the design and style of the site; however, the logo is larger to show the ‘metal-horns’ which showcases the attention to detail of the company. It also contains a message to direct the user back to the website by closing the window.

### 15.	Footer 
The footer uses the logo as a point of conclusion to the web page as well as a message to advertise the designer and copyright of the site, remaining in the current theme of the site and not diverting to author’s own branding.

### 10.	Social Media 
Currently, the only social media that Searchlight Promotions use to advertise their events is on Facebook. No other platforms are used. This highlights the aging demographic’s preferences that typically do not use social media, but do however, remain loyal to Facebook as it was the first social media platform to captivate audiences and has become the only tolerated platform for an aging fan-base.

 As the owner specifically requested not to advertise Facebook with any iconography, a simple button was used to direct a user to their Facebook page that remained consistent with the styling of the page. The vision was to create a website that was preferential to their Facebook page.
