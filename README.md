<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>I approached a fellow metal-head (further refered to as 'the client') who owns a music promotions company in Norwich, and asked if he would like a website as he did not have one for my first project. He agreed to have one built using the information that he had available on Facebook, for the content of the website, as this was currently his sole marketing platform.</p>

<h3>The Aim of the Site</h3>
<p>The primary aim is create a presence beyond the scope of social media to attract rock and metal fans to future events happening in and around Norwich.</p>

<h3>Pupose</h3>
<p>The purpose of the site is to showcase upcoming events and to boost ticket sales for each of the events attracting rock and metal fans who don't use social media.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Looks visulally appealing in line with current marketting material</li>
  <li>Uses a color-paltette that reflects the rock and metal community</li>
  <li>Creates a form that encourages contact from potential bands who would like to be promoted in and around Norwich as well as encourages contact from potential fans who may like additional information or would like to subscribe for email notifications of future events</li>
