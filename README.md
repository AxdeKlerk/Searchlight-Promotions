<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>I approached a fellow metal-head (further refered to as 'the client') who owns a music promotions company in Norwich, and asked if he would like a website as he did not have one for my first project. He agreed to have one built using the information that he had available on Facebook, for the content of the website, as this was currently his sole marketing platform.</p>

<h3>The Aim of the Site</h3>
<p>The primary aim is create a presence beyond the scope of social media to attract rock and metal fans to future events happening in and around Norwich.</p>

<h3>Pupose</h3>
<p>The purpose of the site is to showcase upcoming events and to boost ticket sales for each of the events attracting rock and metal fans who don't use social media.</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>To create a website that:
<ol>
  <li>Looks visulally appealing in line with current marketting material</li>
  <li>Uses a color-paltette that reflects the rock and metal community</li>
  <li>Creates a form that encourages contact from potential bands who would like to be promoted in and around Norwich as well as encourages contact from potential fans who may like additional information or would like to subscribe for email notifications of future events</li>
  <li>Shows a clear and simple guide to what is on offer</li>
</ol></p>

Technology Used
HTML & CSS programming languages

Google Fonts - Quicksilver & Roboto Styles
Font Awesome - Social Media Logos
jQuery - Javascript needed for navbar.
Popper.js - Javascript needed for navbar.
VSCode - IDE for local developement
GIT - Version Control

Testing
Testing was initial carried out using Chromes developer tools to ensure that the site scaled correctly on each screen size.

I frequently used the below tools to help ensure no issues as i progressed through my build.

W3C Markup Validation to validate HTML.

W3C CSS validation to validate CSS

Lighthouse Chrome to audit best security practice and reduce loading times

Unicorn Revealer to help locate overflow issues

During my mid point review me and my mentor listed bugs that required fixing and features to add. On my mentors advice i produced a list of issues with expected time taken to fix on the following scale

1 - Will take a couple of minutes to fix or implement
3 - Will take approx 15 minutes to fix or implement
5 - Will take approx 1 hour to fix or implement
8 - Will take 4 - 8 hours (a working day) to fix or implement
My list is detailed below


Issues and resolutions
During build the following issues were raised

-Collapse Icon Not Showing On Mobile Devices.

During my build the 'hamburger' icon failed to display when switching to mobile devices, this was resolved by adding the navbar-dark theme to the navbar class allowing me then to edit the perameters.

-Navbar not sticking to the top of the page as expected

This was resolved by removing the nav bar from the container which allowed this to function as expected.

all text input on forms flagging as needing @ symbol
in the form parameters each was set to "type=email" instead of being "type=text"

form allowing a blank form to be submitted
Added required to the input tags to ensure core information has to be inputted.

Nav menu scrolling to incorrect position
When using the nav menu items scrolling was taking the user to the content of the section instead of the header, this was resolved by moving the section ID to the title of the page instead of the content containers

Nil links for social media icons opening new tab
As social media pages are not available at the moment clicking the icons opened a new browser with no address when click, this was resolved by removing "target=_blank" from the link code

Fire & Acoustic Section text too cramped on tablets
Reduced padding from the card tiles to allow the text to have more room to display making this easier to read.

Known Issues
Below are a list of problems that are known without resolution

Smooth Scrolling not functioning on Safari or IE:E
This issue is unresolved as this is a browser issue not a site issue.

Title font contast on white backgrounds doesn't meet readability guidelines
The issue has been raised with the client and a mid ground has been established as the client doesn't want to stray too far away from the logo colour.
